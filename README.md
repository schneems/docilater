Creates code documentation for you.

# Setup
Setting up Docilater is fairly easy to do. Simply follow the instructions below, in order, and you'll be generating documentation in no time!

1. Install all the required dependencies. Do this as shown below:
    1. If you do not have [Bundler](bundler.io), install it using
        ```bash
        sudo gem install bundler
        ```
    2. Install our dependencies using
        ```bash
        bundler install
        ```
2. Run start.rb. This will launch the program and guide you onwards.
